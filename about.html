        <p>In March 2020, districts rapidly shifted to remote learning environments which for most, was an entirely new structure of schooling. While there have been significant challenges, there have also been positive experiences for students, staff, and families as we have all engaged in new learning. States and districts have also emphasized the need for access to devices and broadband.  As captured in our report, <a href="https://www.setda.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dell-SETDA-Equitable-Access-Oct2021.pdf" target="_blank">"How States Measure Digital Equity: Current and Proposed Benchmarks"</a>, SETDA and Dell Technologies worked with leaders to assess states' current measurement tools and approaches concerning digital equity knowing that access is a necessary component for moving forward.</p>

        <p>We now have an opportunity to focus on what comes next. We have an opportunity to reinvent school and create new opportunities to build sustainable, innovative learning experiences, moving us closer to Personalized, Competency-Based Learning. These learning experiences will ensure that as we move forward, we are doing so in a way that addresses the individual needs of all students.</p>

      <div class="col s12 m10 offset-m1">
        <p>In 2021, SETDA state leaders gathered to develop a framework that supports the comprehensive implementation of blended learning as a mechanism to personalize instruction and meet the needs of all students. SETDA and Dell Technologies collaborated to develop resources for district and school leaders that are accessible and create a shared process for implementation.</p>
